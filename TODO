* update database on daily basis with new packages and new TLPDBs
  and if necessary new files
  question is how to get the differences only and use cypher, because
  I don't think that neo4j import will allow to import into an 
  existing database
  one needs to use load csv and do merge on create or so???

  https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/



initial import uses neo4j import thus needs :ID and :int statements
later CSV load/merge don't support this and thus needs toInt etc

CSV import

check statements:
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-TLPDB.csv" AS row RETURN toInt(row.revision) ;


load and merge

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-TLPDB.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (tlpdb:TLPDB { uuid: row.uuid, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-Collection.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:Collection { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-TLCore.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:TLCore { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-Package.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:Package { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-Scheme.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:Scheme { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-ConTeXt.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:ConTeXt { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

for files we only have name to set

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-File.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:File { name: row.name }) ;


load relations IS HORRIBLE SLOW!!!

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-contains.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:contains]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-depends.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:depends]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-includes.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:includes {type: row.type}]->(q) ;
