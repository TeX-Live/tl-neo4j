load and merge

for files we only have name to set

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/node-File.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:File { name: row.name }) ;




===========================

In the new case with only one Package node type and category tag



load relations IS HORRIBLE SLOW!!!

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-contains.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:contains]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-depends.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:depends]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/out/edge-includes.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:includes {type: row.type}]->(q) ;




===========================

In the new case with only one Package node type and category tag

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-TLPDB.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (tlpdb:TLPDB { uuid: row.uuid, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-Package.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:Package { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, category: row.category, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-File.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:File { name: row.name }) ;

in the new case loading the edges is much faster!

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-contains.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:TLPDB { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:Package { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-depends.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:Package { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:Package { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:depends]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-includes.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:Package { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:File { name: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:includes {type: row.type}]->(q) ;

====================================

With multiple labels!!!

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-TLPDB.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (tlpdb:TLPDB { uuid: row.uuid, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) ;

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-TLPackage.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:Package { uuid: row.uuid, name: row.name, revision: toInt(row.revision) }) 
  ON CREATE call apoc.create.node();

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/node-File.csv" AS row 
  MERGE (c:File { name: row.name }) ;

We cannot set mutiple labels parametrized when loading from CSV!!!

in the new case loading the edges is much faster!

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-contains.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:TLPDB { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:Package { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:contains]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-depends.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:Package { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:Package { uuid: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:depends]->(q) ;

USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///tlpdb/48871/outnew/edge-includes.csv" AS row
  MATCH (p:Package { uuid: row.`:START_ID`}), (q:File { name: row.`:END_ID` } )
  MERGE (p)-[r:includes {type: row.type}]->(q) ;



===================

FINAL WIth mutiple labels but separate files for labels of pcakges
