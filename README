TeX Live and Neo4j
==================

This is a simple attempt to represent the TeX Live Database (at some point) in
a graph database, in particular Neo4j. 

The script `tl-neo4j-dum` creates the necessary csv files in the directory `out`,
which can be imported into Neo4j using `neo4j-import`. The whole process is shown
in `do-all`.

The directory `slides` contains a presentation held at the Japan Neo4j user Group
Meeting in Tokyo in September 2018 (in Japanese).

All scripts and material is (c) 2018  Norbert Preining, licensed under the GPLv3 
or any later version. Some of the images used in the slides are excluded from this.
